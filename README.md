# SMS-Based-Motor-Automation-System

Build a 3-Phase motor automation system that responds and replies to SMS commands. Compatible with Arduino or any compatible Atmel microcontroller. Code is well commented for easier editing.

Here are the list of modules used in this project:

* Arduino Uno (ATMega328P) or any other compatible Atmel microcontroller.
* LCD 1602 (16 x 2 LCD).
* ACS712 for current measurement.
* 3 analog voltage sensors to measure each phase potential difference.
* SIM800L module for SMS functionality.
* A button to toggle motor state (on/off).
